# PLOGS(Pseudotemporal Locating and Ordering of Gene by Single-cell)

PLOGS is a tool to identify marker genes for cell clusters, calculate the pseudotime of genes and profile genes map accoding to cell map. It can be directly used in the [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) workflow.

PLOGS consists of three core functions: 
* (i) `get_DEG_single` to find genes that are differentially expressed in only one cell type based on normalized raw counts of scRNA-seq data; 
* (ii) `get_DEG_multiple` to find genes that are differentially expressed in one or more  cell types based on normalized raw counts of scRNA-seq data; 
* (iii) `get_genes_pseudotime_location` to calculate the pseudotemporal expression of individual genes based on pseudotime ordering of cells and to locate genes into suitable coordinates based on the cellsâ€™ locations.

## Installation

PLOGS depends on numpy, scipy, pandas, scanpy,anndata. The package is available on pip and conda, and can be easily installed as follows:

	pip3 install PLOGS

or

	conda install -c bioconda PLOGS

## Usage and Documentation
* identifing marker genes for cell clusters:
		PLOGS has the option to slot into the spot occupied by `scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups()` in the scanpy workflow](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html). The basic syntax to run on scanpy's AnnData object is as follows:
```python
import PLOGS
PLOGS.get_DEG_single(rdata, adata)
```
    or 
```python
PLOGS.get_DEG_multiple(rdata, adata)
```
You can provide which `adata.obs` column to use for batch discrimination via the `batch_key` parameter. This defaults to `'batch'`, which is created by scanpy when you merge multiple AnnData objects (e.g. if you were to import multiple samples separately and then concatenate them).
